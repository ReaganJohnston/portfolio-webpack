        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Reagan. 
        </p>

        <p>
          If you were to crack open my 8th-grade letter to my future-self, you'd see that I wanted to become an Olympian and my future goal was to&nbsp<p2>build stuff with computers</p2>. One of these remains true
        </p>

        <p>
          Although my dream of going to the Olympics for swimming was short lived (I do still swim on the odd occasion), software developing continues to be a strong passion and aspiration of mine. Ranging wildly from&nbsp<p2>animated web-dev projects</p2>, to automating internet-printing from a 2004 printer, I've dipped my toes in a few aspects of this craft. 
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not staring blankly at the computer screen, you will probably find me swimming, reading a great book (I've been very interested in financial literacy lately) or drinking all the coffee in my pantry.
        </p>
